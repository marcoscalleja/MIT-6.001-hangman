# MIT-6.001-hangman
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.



This project contains my work done for MIT Opencourseware's class 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Problem Set 2, in which I implemented a variation of the classic word game Hangman. Included in addition to my code are the instructions for the problem set and a word.txt file that the game uses. MIT provides this material under a Creative Commons License.
